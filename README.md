# Password Generator Challenge

In this challenge I was tasked with writing the JavaScript code to run in the password generator site. The HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript to display the generated password on to the page was provided.

**My Process**

- I began by breaking down the process in to the steps I imagined it would take to get to the end result.

- I turned those steps into hypothetical functions I would then use to build the final function.

- I then turned those hypothetical functions into psudocode.

- from there I wrote out the building block functions, global variables, and arrays.

-finally, I put everything, along with a switch statement to check conditions, together into the final "generatePassword" function that the provided button would run.
